# TokenGraph

This repository contains all code and pre-processed data to rerun the TokenGraph classification experiments. The text
graphs can be downloaded from HERE (will be added after review)
and the `graphs` folder with subfolders for each dataset should be placed in the
`TokenGraph` folder. It is also possible to put the raw data in the `TokenGraph` folder and rerun graph creation as
part of the `main.py` script. The code to run training and evaluation is also located in `main.py`. There is a CONFIG
at the top of the script that allows to set different parameters (e.g., dataset to use, hyperparameters).
